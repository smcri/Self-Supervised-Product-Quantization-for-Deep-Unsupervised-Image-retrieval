# Self-Supervised-Product-Quantization-for-Deep-Unsupervised-Image-retrieval

This is a novel image retrieval system which uses a cross quantized contrastive learning strategy to jointly learn codewords as well as extraction of image descriptors, allowing for effective image retrieval.

This project extends the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02244.pdf) by Young Kyun Jang and  Nam Ik Cho,  which uses two views for contrastive learning. In this case, we have extended the system to use n views, which achieves a similar mAP(mean average precision)value in 500 epochs, as the original paper did in 5000 epochs.
