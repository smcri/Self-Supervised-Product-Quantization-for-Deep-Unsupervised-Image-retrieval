# Self-Supervised-Product-Quantization-for-Deep-Unsupervised-Image-retrieval


This project extends the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02244.pdf) by Young Kyun Jang and  Nam Ik Cho,  which uses two views for contrastive learning. In this case, we have extended the system to use n views, which achieves a similar mAP(mean average precision)value in 500 epochs, as the original paper did in 5000 epochs.

The [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02244.pdf) proposes a novel image retrieval system which uses a cross quantized contrastive learning strategy to jointly learn codewords as well as extraction of image descriptors, allowing for effective image retrieval using product quantization.

Given below are query images and retrieval results :
